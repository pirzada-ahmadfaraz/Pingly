```
üö® Monitor Alert

Your monitor has gone down. Please check your service.

Monitor: My Website          Status: DOWN ‚ùå
URL: https://example.com     Time: 1/26/2024, 3:45:00 PM

Error:
Connection timeout
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Invalid Slack webhook URL"
- Make sure the URL starts with `https://hooks.slack.com/services/`
- The URL should look like: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/[WORKSPACE]/[CHANNEL]/[TOKEN]`
- Check that you copied the entire URL

### "Invalid webhook URL or webhook is disabled"
- The webhook might have been deleted or deactivated
- Check your Slack app settings at https://api.slack.com/apps
- Go to your app ‚Üí Incoming Webhooks ‚Üí verify it's still there
- Create a new webhook if needed

### Not receiving test message
- Check that the webhook is in the correct channel
- Verify you have permission to view that channel
- The Slack app might need to be reinstalled - try creating a new webhook
- Wait a minute and try again

### Not receiving notifications
- Verify monitor has `notifyOnFailure` enabled (enabled by default)
- Check that the monitor actually went down
- Look at backend logs for errors
- Test the webhook by clicking "Disconnect" then "Add" again
- Make sure the Slack app wasn't removed from your workspace

## ‚ùì Common Questions

**Q: Can I use the same webhook for multiple Pingly accounts?**
A: Yes! Multiple users can use the same webhook URL.

**Q: Will I get spammed with notifications?**
A: No! Pingly only sends ONE notification when a monitor goes from UP ‚Üí DOWN. It won't spam you while it's down.

**Q: Can I customize the notification format?**
A: Not yet, but coming soon! For now, you get a standard Block Kit formatted alert.

**Q: What if I delete the webhook in Slack?**
A: Notifications will stop. Just create a new webhook in your Slack app and update it in Pingly.

**Q: Can I send to multiple Slack channels?**
A: Not yet, but coming soon! For now, one webhook per account. Workaround: Create multiple webhooks in Slack and rotate them, or use Slack's native channel forwarding.

**Q: Does this work with Slack Connect (external workspaces)?**
A: Yes! You can create webhooks for channels in external workspaces if you have permission.

**Q: Can I use this in Slack's free tier?**
A: Yes! Incoming Webhooks work on all Slack plans including the free tier.

**Q: How do I change the notification channel?**
A: You need to create a new webhook for the new channel and update it in Pingly. Slack doesn't allow changing the channel of an existing webhook.
