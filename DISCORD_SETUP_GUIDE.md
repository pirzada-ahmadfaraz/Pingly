## üé® What Notifications Look Like

When a monitor goes down, you'll receive a nice embedded message:

```
üö® Monitor Alert
Your monitor has gone down. Please check your service.

Monitor: My Website
Status: DOWN ‚ùå
URL: https://example.com
Error: Connection timeout
Time: 1/26/2024, 3:45:00 PM
```

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Invalid Discord webhook URL"
- Make sure the URL starts with `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/`
- The URL should look like: `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/[ID]/[TOKEN]`
- Check that you copied the entire URL

### "Invalid webhook URL or webhook is disabled"
- The webhook might have been deleted from Discord
- Check Discord ‚Üí Server Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks
- Create a new webhook if needed

### Not receiving test message
- Check that the webhook is in the correct channel
- Verify you have permission to view that channel
- Discord might have rate limits - wait a minute and try again

### Not receiving notifications
- Verify monitor has `notifyOnFailure` enabled (enabled by default)
- Check that the monitor actually went down
- Look at Vercel backend logs for errors
- Test the webhook by clicking "Disconnect" then "Add" again
