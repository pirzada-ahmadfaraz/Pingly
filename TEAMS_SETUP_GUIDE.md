   - Name: `Pingly Alerts` (or whatever you like)
   - Upload an image: (optional) Add a custom icon
   - Click "Create"

7. **Copy the webhook URL**
   - The URL looks like: `https://outlook.office.com/webhook/[GUID]/IncomingWebhook/[CHANNEL]/[GUID]`
   - Or: `https://[tenant].webhook.office.com/webhookb2/[GUID]@[GUID]/IncomingWebhook/[CHANNEL]/[GUID]`
   - Click "Copy to clipboard"

## üé® What Notifications Look Like

When a monitor goes down, you'll receive a formatted MessageCard:

```
üö® Monitor Alert

Your monitor has gone down
Please check your service

Monitor: My Website
Status: DOWN ‚ùå
URL: https://example.com
Error: Connection timeout
Time: 1/26/2024, 3:45:00 PM
```

The card will have a red accent color on the left side to indicate it's an alert.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Invalid Microsoft Teams webhook URL"
- Make sure the URL contains `webhook.office.com` or `outlook.office.com/webhook`
- The URL should look like: `https://[domain].webhook.office.com/webhookb2/...`
- Check that you copied the entire URL

### "Invalid webhook URL or webhook is disabled"
- The webhook connector might have been removed from Teams
- Check Teams ‚Üí Channel ‚Üí Connectors ‚Üí Configured
- Recreate the webhook if needed

### Not receiving test message
- Check that you're looking at the correct channel
- Verify the connector is still configured in Teams
- The webhook might be disabled - check connector status
- Wait a minute and try again

### Not receiving notifications
- Verify monitor has `notifyOnFailure` enabled (enabled by default)
- Check that the monitor actually went down
- Look at backend logs for errors
- Test the webhook by clicking "Remove" then "Add Webhook URL" again
- Make sure the Teams connector wasn't removed from the channel

### Connector disappeared
- If someone removes the connector from Teams, notifications will stop
- Go back to Teams ‚Üí Channel ‚Üí Connectors
- Find the "Pingly Alerts" connector and remove it
- Create a new webhook and update in Pingly

## ‚ùì Common Questions

**Q: Can I use the same webhook for multiple Pingly accounts?**
A: Yes! Multiple users can use the same webhook URL.

**Q: Will I get spammed with notifications?**
A: No! Pingly only sends ONE notification when a monitor goes from UP ‚Üí DOWN. It won't spam you while it's down.

**Q: Can I customize the notification format?**
A: Not yet, but coming soon! For now, you get a standard MessageCard format.

**Q: What if I remove the connector in Teams?**
A: Notifications will stop. Just create a new webhook connector and update it in Pingly.

**Q: Can I send to multiple Teams channels?**
A: Not yet, but coming soon! For now, one webhook per account. Workaround: Create webhooks in multiple channels and rotate them, or use Power Automate to forward messages.

**Q: Does this work with guest users?**
A: Yes, if the guest user has permission to view the channel where the webhook is configured.

**Q: Can I use this in Teams free version?**
A: Yes! Incoming Webhooks work in all Teams plans including the free version.

**Q: How do I change the notification channel?**
A: You need to create a new webhook connector in the new channel and update it in Pingly. Teams doesn't allow changing the channel of an existing webhook.

**Q: What's the difference between MessageCard and Adaptive Card?**
A: Pingly currently uses MessageCard format (O365 Connector Card) which is simple and widely supported. Adaptive Cards are more advanced but require different setup. We may add Adaptive Card support in the future.

**Q: Can I use this with Microsoft Teams for personal use?**
A: Incoming Webhooks are only available in Teams for work/school accounts, not personal Microsoft accounts.
